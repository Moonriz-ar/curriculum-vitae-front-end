            <p>An experienced wizard who is looking for a change of career. After travelling extensively over the past 200 years, I'm looking for a more solid and stable role during my never-ending stay in the undying lands. I've helped Middle-earth's denizens to combat the powers of evil; now I'm looking for a company to help me combat the power of boredom in the ever-quiet of Valinor.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To any role I'll bring wisdom, a sharp tongue and a lot of weed. During power cuts, I'll light the way with my handy staff, errands can be run at super speed on my fast-as-the-wind stead Shadowfax, and of course I'll never be late, arring precisely when I mean to.</p>
